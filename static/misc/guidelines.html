<h1>Guidelines for this website</h1>
<div class=time><time datetime="2025-08-17">2025-08-17</time></div>

<p>
A website is a complicated thing.
There's a huge amount of stuff to consider, decades of legacy cruft, and a lot to avoid (as they say, &ldquo;it's the notes you don't play.&rdquo;)

<p>
This page is written largely for myself, so that I don't lose track of my own goals and methods for this site, but it's reasonable to record these in a public place in case anyone like me (i.e., bad at this) wants some resources to help them write good, accessible websites.

<p>
Now, I'll note that I'm pretty stupid when it comes to frontend stuff, and that creates some amount of incentive for me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">keep things simple</a>.
So I have to confess that some of this might be rationalization: It's not that I'm making websites the only way I know how, it's that I'm making websites the <em>better</em> way!

<p>
But also, I seem to have different design goals than many others.
I want a website that works without javascript wherever I don't need it.
I want a website that's reasonably functional without CSS.
I want a website that's mostly HTML, and doesn't try to reimplement stuff the browser does ten times better and faster, and with better accessibility characteristics.
I want a website where most of the data you download is actual content that you see.

<p>
Accessibility is a priority &mdash; probably <em>the</em> priority.
That means accessibility for people with <a href="https://danluu.com/web-bloat/">slow or intermittent internet</a>, <a href="https://danluu.com/slow-device/">slow devices</a>, old and underpowered browsers, or small screens.
It also means accessibility for people who use screen readers or other assistive technology.
Generally, these benefits compound and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curb_cut_effect">help everybody</a>; a website that has these characteristics is a website that's fast for those with good internet, is understandable for search engines and reasonably easy for machine translation, and can be used by people working without images in a terminal.

<p>
It's also worth paying attention to the different ways people want to use the web.
Respecting dark- and light-mode settings with media queries is the most obvious example.
Some users have more &ldquo;heavy-weight&rdquo; opinions, though.
For example, there are <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">those with strong opinions on javascript</a>.

<p>
There are also those who, like me, often &ldquo;print&rdquo; pages from the web.
For me, this is to download onto an e-ink device.
Supporting this well involves <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Printing">using media queries for printing</a>.
One straightforward choice is to display link targets for printed content, since you can't exactly click a link on the web.

<figure>
<pre>
@media print {
	a[href]::after {
		content: " (" attr(href) ")"
	}
}
</pre>
<figcaption>CSS for displaying link targets in printed pages</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
I will admit this site doesn't do things perfectly in terms of accessibility right now.
While I probably don't need to bother with aria, I ought to better follow <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/HTML">the MDN's accessibility recommendations</a>.
There's also the matter that many semantic elements are (relatively) newfangled; how portable is HTML5 and CSS3 (and SVG support)?
Is it a good tradeoff to add polyfills for browsers which don't quite handle semantic HTML?

<p>
Language and encoding are also considerations, since the web is a global platform and &ldquo;English is the implicit default&rdquo; isn't actually a good way for the world to work.
As part of that, it's good to declare which language you're writing in, so that the browser and OS don't have to guess, and that you're using UTF-8, since that's basically what you have to use.
