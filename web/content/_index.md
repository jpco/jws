# jpco (pronounced "Jay Pico")

Born in Alaska; now a site reliability engineer on [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute).  Supposedly, the rate of Alaska-born SREs is unusually high, though I don't have real data to back that up.

Previously a devops intern at Silicon Mechanics.
