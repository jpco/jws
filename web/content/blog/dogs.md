I've created a [list of dogs](/dogs.txt).  It's not my list, but I've put it there.

Because I am a Good Web-Era Developer, there is also an [API endpoint](/dogs.json) to the list of good dog breeds.  It's very RESTful -- it's stateless, cacheable, and handles GET requests gracefully.  I'm the kind of web developer people are dying to get.[^1]

[^1]: Are we still making jokes about REST?  Or have we given that... a REST[^2]?

[^2]: Sorry; done now.
