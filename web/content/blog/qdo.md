A few months ago, I was sitting in a "How do you keep your 'things-to-do' organized?" conversation with some co-workers, being generally useless, since my answer to that question is essentially "I don't."

I have tried several to-do list apps over the course of my life---Wunderlist, Google Keep, Trello, todo.txt---but inevitably, I give up on these and go back to paper and pen for my upcoming tasks (or, the even worse method of "try really hard to keep it all in my head").

There are generally two reasons I get frustrated with anything other than paper and pen:

1. Many apps have a structure of lists, which contain tasks.  My brain isn't well-structured that way, so trying to fit tasks into lists causes friction.

2. When I want to track the things I need to do, I also want to track the smaller things which make that one up, and the sub-sub-tasks which make up those sub-tasks, etc.  Many apps have some level of sub-tasks (one? two?), but I generally want to be unfettered in how many levels I want.

While my co-workers spoke about the various methods that worked for them, I came to the private realization that my paper-and-pen methodology is actually extremely consistent and (as far as I knew) fairly unique.  Generally, the process looks like this.  First, I write out a tree of things which need doing, like so:

```
 - make doctors appointments
   - eye doctor
   - regular doctor
   - dentist
     - find a dentist in town
     - make an appointment with them
 - work
   - big cool project
     - documentation
       - playbook
       - training docs
     - finish refactor
       - refactor calling code with new type
       - rewrite algorithm
   - set up no-oncalls
 - personal projects
   - blog post
   - website
     - add a license
     - automate spell-checking
     - minify everything
```

Then, of these tasks, I write a list of the ones that need to be done first.  In this example, supposing I'm currently at work, I might write:

```
 - eye doctor appt
 - dermatologist appt
 - set up no-oncalls
 - big cool project playbook
 - finish big cool project refactor
```

and then proceed to do those items in order.

This is, for me, a great organization practice.  Writing the tree allows me to build an unordered, top-down view of "things needing doing", which are loosely structured, and which allow me the freedom to break them down as much as I need until they're regular-sized tasks that can be done in less than a few hours.  Then, after I have everything down, I can go ahead and figure out what I want to do right now.
