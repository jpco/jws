Recently, the Klim font foundary released [the Signifier typeface](https://klim.co.nz/blog/signifier-design-information/), "a Brutalist response to 17th century typefaces" designed by Kris Sowersby.  Read the full post --- it's a pretty incredible typeface, and a very good read, if you happen to be interested in typefaces --- and it explains and illustrates the artistic attitude and movement of Brutalism in an effective way.  To excerpt a quote the Signifier design document pulls from Peter Smithson:

> Brutalism is not concerned with the material as such but rather the quality of the material, that is with the question: what can it do? And by analogy: there is a way of handling gold in Brutalist manner and it does not mean rough and cheap, it means: what is its raw quality?

One of the sources of the term "Brutalism" is the French phrase _b√©ton brut_, meaning "raw concrete".  This term should make a lot of sense to those familiar with buildings called "Brtualist": most are not only made of concrete, but _ostentatiously_ so; the overwhelming sense of a Brutalist building is that of concrete, metal, glass, and scale.
