I've updated the [list of dogs](/dogs.txt).  It now corresponds to the updated dog rankings.  I am beginning to feel bad about moving dog breeds downwards in the list---what did they do to deserve this?

Every dog should be ranked first.  There is no total ordering of dog breeds (well, there's lexicographic).

The [API endpoint](/dogs.json) to the list of good dog breeds has also been updated.  All consumers should update, though the dogs will most likely not be offended if the clients choose not to do so.  Consumers are reminded that there are very many good dog breeds not in the top 100, and dog breeds have disappeared from the list since last year.

An analysis of good dog ranking changes over time---and, potentially, extending the API to support keying by year---is likely in order.  Product management will review this new requirement and prioritize it against other good-dog-related launches and goals for the year.  Sorry folks, it's out of my hands.
